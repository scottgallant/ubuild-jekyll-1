        <p>uBuild is an open-source Jekyll based theme that doubles as a builder tool inside the Forestry content manager. It's easy to get started!</p>
        <p>1. Fork the repo and import the site into Forestry (or use our magic button).</p>
        <p>2. Add a new page to your pages directory in Forestry and select the **** template.</p>
        <p>3. Add and customize the available Blocks and preview them as you go along.</p>
        <p>4. Create your own Blocks and contribute to the project.</p>
